  <p>Made out of the grimey streets of Syracuse, NY, Go 4 Gusto Productions embodies the all or nothing mindset.
  All we know is to go for it all and bring the gold home. No half stepping, no bullshitting.Created out of the
  Nob Hill Apartments circa 2017 by CEO and Executive Na$ty Nij during a time when his back was against the wall.
  He decided "yo fuck it i'm going 4 the gusto". Rolled a fat splee made a beat and magic was made. Here at Gusto 
  everyone has a purpose:The lost, forgotten, blacksheep,nerds,the recluse. Join us on this journey </p>
